Programming a toy computer from scratch}

\bigskip

\noindent This book introduces how computer hardware, programming languages and
operating systems work, via a practical example which can be understood down to
the smallest detail. For this it explains how you can assemble and program a
toy computer, in an entirely bottom-up way, without using any existing
programming tool. The end result is a toy, monotasking operating system with a
command line shell, a text editor, a compiler, and a few utilities, in less
than 3300 lines.
