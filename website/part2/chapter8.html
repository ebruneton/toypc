    <h3>8.3.9 Final code</h3>

    <p>To do these experiments with the emulator, <a href="../emulator.html#host">open it</a> and then follow the
      instructions (in the "Host" panel). You don't need to download the <code>scripts.zip</code> file.

    <h2>8.4 Example program</h2>

    <p>To do these experiments with the emulator, do the ones above first, and continue with the instructions in this
      section of the book, without reloading the emulator.

    <p><b>Note:</b> due to the differences between the emulator and the real Arduino, the LED should stop blinking at
      some point (the simulated Boot Assistant's <code>G</code> command stops after a fixed number of instructions have
      been executed). The blink rate is also not the same as on the real Arduino (it depends on the performance of the
      computer running the emulator).
