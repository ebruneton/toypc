    <h3>7.5.3 Run from RAM</h3>

    <p>To do these experiments with the emulator, <a href="../emulator.html#host">open it</a> and then follow the
      instructions (in the "Host" panel).

    <p><b>Note:</b> due to the differences between the emulator and the real Arduino, the LED should stop blinking at
      some point (the simulated Boot Assistant's <code>G</code> command stops after a fixed number of instructions have
      been executed).

    <h3>7.5.4 Run from flash</h3>

    <p>To do these experiments with the emulator, <a href="../emulator.html#host">open it</a> and then follow the
      instructions (in the "Host" panel).

    <p><b>Note:</b> due to the differences between the emulator and the real Arduino, all blinks should have the same
      duration. This is because the emulator does not simulate the Watchdog Timer. The blink rate is also not
      the same as on the real Arduino (it depends on the performance of the computer running the emulator).
