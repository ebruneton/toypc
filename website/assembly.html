    <h1>Assembly instructions</h1>

    <p>This page explains how to assemble the hardware components of the toy computer described in the book "<a
        href="toypc.pdf">Programming a toy computer from scratch</a>".

    <h2>Soldering</h2>

    <p>In order to use the Adafruit RA8875 driver board (hereafter called the "graphics card") you need to solder the
      header pins provided with it. Likewise, you need to solder the header pins provided with the level converter,
      which is required to connect the PS/2 keyboard. For this the easiest is to use a breadboard, and to plug the
      header pins in it first:

      <a href="figures/breadboard.jpg"><img src="figures/breadboard.jpg" class="figure"></a>

    <p>Use 15 pins for the graphics card, and two 6-pins rows for the level converter. The graphics card has pins on
      only
      one side. To provide support on the other side, plug two header pins with their top part cut, as shown above. Then
      put the cards on these pins, and solder them in place. If you have never done any soldering before, watch
      tutorials online, and practice with an empty perfboard first. To avoid having to buy a soldering station, go to a
      makerspace if you can. You can also get some advice there.

    <h2>Connecting the screen</h2>

    <p>Once the graphics card is in place and soldered, connect it to the Arduino and to the screen with jumper
      wires as described in the book (in Figures 10.6), and as illustrated in the following photos.

    <h3>Connections to the Arduino</h3>

      <li>The connections on the Arduino side:

      </li>
      <li>A side view of the graphics card, showing the two partially cut header pins (right) used to maintain it
        parallel to the breadboard:
        <a href="figures/ra8875-side.jpg"><img src="figures/ra8875-side.jpg" class="figure"></a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Connections to the screen</h3>

    <p>Connect the 40-pin connector of the LCD panel to the graphics card as illustrated below (notice the "1" and "40"
      numbers). For this, slide out the black "ears" on each side of the white connector, insert the flat cable, and
      slide the ears back in.

      <a href="figures/ra8875.jpg"><img src="figures/ra8875.jpg" class="figure"></a>

    <h2>Connecting the keyboard</h2>

    <p>Once the level converter is in place and soldered, connect it to the Arduino and to the keyboard with jumper
      wires as described in the book (in Figures 11.4), and as illustrated in the following photos.

    <h3>Connections to the Arduino</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Overview of the connections between the Arduino (top) and the level converter (bottom right):
        <a href="figures/overview.jpg"><img src="figures/overview.jpg" class="figure"></a>
      </li>
      <li>The connections on the Arduino side:
        <a href="figures/arduino.jpg"><img src="figures/arduino.jpg" class="figure"></a>
      </li>
      <li>The connections on the level converter:
        <a href="figures/level-converter.jpg"><img src="figures/level-converter.jpg" class="figure"></a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Connections to the keyboard</h3>

    <p>Connect the level converter to the PS/2 side of the USB to PS/2 plug adapter provided with the keyboard, as shown
      in Figure 11.4 in the book.

      <a href="figures/plug-adapter.jpg"><img src="figures/plug-adapter.jpg" class="figure"></a>

    <p>The PS/2 pins are too close to connect them all with jumper wires. To solve this, remove the black plastic
      case around one of the wires (here the brown one, connected to the DATA pin; the black, red and orange wires are
      connected to the GND, +5V, and CLK pins, respectively):

    <h2>Computer Case (optional)</h2>

    <p>To make your toy computer easier to use it is recommended to attach the above components to a single support. One
      possibility is to use the following blueprint. It is designed to be cut in a panel whose thickness is 5mm. If you
      have access to a laser cutting machine, you can use a poplar plywood panel for that.

      <a href="figures/case.svg" class="figure" style="padding: 0; position: relative">
        <img src="figures/case.svg" style="width: 100%">
        <img src="figures/case-overlay.svg" style="position: absolute; z-index: 1; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%">
      </a>
      <center>The blueprint for the computer case shown on the front and back covers of the book.</center>

    <p>Attach the Arduino and the breadboard on the back of (A), put (B) on the front, with the screen inside it, and
      pass the 40-pin flat cable from the LCD through the hole in (A).

      <a href="figures/lcd.jpg"><img src="figures/lcd.jpg" class="figure"></a>

    <p>Then put (C) on top of (B). Finally, use (D), (E), and (F) as a tilted support for these assembled components.
      Use the remaining parts to attach the PS/2 to USB adapter on (E), with the USB port on the outside:
